 * callback when the user short-clicks the element, and the long-click callback when the user
 * long-clicks the element.
 *
 * It returns an object with a function to call to trigger the mouse-up action, if some other way
 * of triggering the mouse-up action is needed. As an example, a checkbox needs to handle clicks
 * itself for accessibility, so its `onClick` handler calls the `onClickEnd` function returned by
 * this hook.
 *
 * This hook also returns the ID of the long-click timer, in case it needs clearing due to some
 * event that happens outside this hook.

 * @param {function} onClick Called when the user short-clicks the element
 * @param {function} onLongClick Called when the user long-clicks the element
 * @param {number} delay? Time in milliseconds to wait before considering a mouse click a long press
