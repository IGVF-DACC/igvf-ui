/**
 * This module provides a class for caching server data in a Redis database. The primary purpose is
 * to reduce the requests to the data provider. It does not reduce traffic between the NextJS
 * server and the browser.
 *
 * An alternate use for the cache is to temporarily persist data specific to a user between sessions
 * so they see the same data on different browsers or devices. Don't rely on this persistence
 * however. Losing this data shouldn't significantly affect the user experience.
 *
 * Use this code only on the Next.js server. Documentation in lib/docs/cache.md.
